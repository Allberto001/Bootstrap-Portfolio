                        <h2>About Me</h2>


                        <img src="assets/images/image1.jpg" class="rounded float-left mb-0 mt-3" class="img-fluid" alt="an image of a aurora">

                        <p class="mt-3">Hello there and welcome to my "about me" page that I created, in here you'll find every reason why
                            I would be an asset to you. I'm your usual persistent everyday person who hates leaving things
                            undone, I cannot leave a task until I feel satisfied with the results and well im just simply
                            stubborn on reaching as close as possible to perfection with my work. Hopefully that's the type
                            of guy your looking for in your work place.</p>

                        <p>I went a little straight to the point but I always prefer to cut to the chase. The type of job experiences
                            that I had in my past can most likely benefit you in your company as well. I've been a manager
                            for a small smoothie joint called Boba at Avetura Mall in Aventura FL for about 3 years I would
                            say and I can tell you that it has taught me leadership skills, managing people is never an easy
                            task. That job gave me a strong sense of responsibility, I needed to make sure we always had
                            all the materials necessary to keep the business running in a smoothly fashion. I also obtained
                            another job at Metro PCS as a sales rep in Miami FL, that job it's where my love for phones and
                            tech in general was born. We would have early hands on tech before it got released to the public
                            and had early training on all these new phones before selling them so we knew what features to
                            highligh. During that job I started school at Miami Dade College in Miami Fl in the field of
                            Electronics Engineering which was a variety of things from coding, computer science, understanding
                            schematics, microprocessors, analog and digital communications and more. I finally acheived this
                            degree in May of 2018 , during my time in school I had switch to another job and starting working
                            for Comcast in Hialeah FL as another sales rep. This job was a bit challenging at first because
                            customers usually came to fight about their bills and services but eventually I got the hang
                            of things. In this job I really had to learn how to be a good problem solver and develop some
                            true customer service skills. With time I knew how to sway attention to the products I wanted
                            the customer to purchase while fixing their issues. Im currenlty still in this job and been here
                            for five years as of the making of this page.

                        <p>Hopefully that was more detailed for you than that first paragraph, right now im working on my certification
                            on becoming a fully-stacked developer in the University of Miami. In my contact page you can
                            reach me and in my portfolio page you can explore all the projects that I was able to create
                            while earning my certification.
